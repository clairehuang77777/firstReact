# React Checkout Progress App

This is my first React project, a simple multi-step checkout flow featuring dynamic progress tracking, cart updates, and a user-friendly interface.

## Features

- **Multi-Step Navigation**: Navigate through the steps with "Next Page" and "Prev Page" buttons.
- **Dynamic Progress Bar**: The progress bar updates dynamically as the user proceeds through the steps, marking completed steps with a checkmark.
- **Shopping Cart Integration**: A shopping cart displays the selected items on each page.
- **Credit Card Form**: Users can input their credit card details and cardholder's name. On form submission, a success page thanks the user for their order.
